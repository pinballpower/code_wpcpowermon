# Bus protocol

## General

The bus consists of 8 data lines and some signal "address" lines. In general, there is only one address line active at a given time.
Signals are L-active, the default state of the address and data lines is H. New data will be fetched by the power driver board on the raising edge of an address.

There is often some "noise" on the data bus. This usually happens when an address signal goes to L. As the signal is fetched at the raising edge, this is not a problem.

A data transfer cycle takes about 400ns.

## Solenoids

Solenoids (and flash lamps) are organised in 4 groups of 8 devices. There are 4 separate solenoid addresses SOL1-SOL4. If no solenoid is active, they will be set to zero regularly. 

## Lamp matrix

Lamp matrix is organized in 8 columns of 8 rows each. The rows are multiplex, which means
each column is only active 1/8s of the time.

First the column is set (only one bit on the data bus is set), next the row data will be set. As the end of a cycle all lamps will be reset to 0. There is another transfer on the bus at the end of each cycle. It's cause is unknown. However as this happens at the end of the cycle, we can simply ignore it.

## Reading data

### The correct way

As the bus is designed to directly drive Flip-Flops, the correct way is as follows

- Wait until an address line goes to 0, read the address
- Wait until this address line goes back to 1, read the data

### Simplified way (used in this project)

The data transfers on the bus always seem to take around 400ms. I haven't seen any other types in logic analyser traces. Therefore with a hardware that just listens on the bus, the following method will also work
- Wait until an address line goes to 0
- Wait 200ns
- Read address and data from the bus at the same time
